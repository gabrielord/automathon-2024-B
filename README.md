# Automathon 2024

![](./images/automathon.png)

This was a competition organised by the Automathon group with the aim of detecting DeepFake videos that took place over 24 hours.

Our group chose to use a ResNet 18 and obtained an accuracy of 75% in the detections and won 3rd place in the competition. The model was trained using a GPU called DGX, provided by the event organisers.

The final model can be found in `run.py`, which must be run with the command

```bash
.\run
```
